          On the edge of the world stands the progressive town of Binaryville,
          where technology is a way of life.The robots who live, work, and play
          in Binaryville learn from an early age that magic is made simply by
          combining 0 's and 1' s.For the Binaryville robots, every waking
          thought and every sleeping dream is consumed with unique permutationsâ€¦
          and endless possibilities.
